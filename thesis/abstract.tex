We develop and test a framework to compute numerically the analytic
continuation of some instanton solutions of non linear field
equations. The holomorphic nature of the solutions enable us to treat
the analytic continuation as an initial value problem, which can be
integrated using standard numerical procedures avaliable for Cauchy
problems.
