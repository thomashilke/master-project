We develop and test a framework to compute numerically the
analytical continuation of some static solutions of non linear
field equations. The holomorphic nature of the static solution
enable us to treat the analytical continuation as an initial value
problem, which can be integrated using standard numerical
procedues avaliable for initial value differential problems.
